	<p>Each participant is allowed to submit <b>one</b> abstract as the <b>presenting</b> author. You may be an author in more than one abstract but will not be allowed to present more than one. Please verify you abstracts for clearness, conciseness, and correctness of spelling and grammar in advance of submission. Each submitted abstract should only have one presenting author. Abstracts must be submitted in English and if selected for presentation, all content (talk or poster) must be presented in English.</p>

	<h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>

	<p>Abstract evaluation will be double-blind and evaluated by 3 committee members. Authors are responsible for anonymizing their submissions. Do not include author names, author affiliations, or acknowledgments in the abstract, body, or figures of the submission. If you need to cite one of your own publications, use anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing (e.g., write "in previous works [1]...” instead of “in our previous work [1]...”).</p>

	<p>Abstract submissions will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: significance, originality, clarity and relevance to the symposium audience. Selected abstracts will be informed if they were selected for Poster or Oral presentation.</p>

	<p>For question on abstract submission, please send an email to xxx.</p>
