	<h2>Regular Registration</h2>

	<p>The registration fee includes two happy hours (Monday and Tuesday), five coffee breaks, one workshop (Tuesday) and one networking lunch with speakers (Wednesday).</p>

	<p>In the interest of prioritizing trainees that will benefit from the conference, we require that you submit a youtube link for a video 1:30 minutes in English answering the following question: <b><i>What do you like the most about science and how will the symposium advance your career?</i></b></p>

	<h2>Abstract submission</h2>

	<p>To request financial support (e.g., registration waiver or a travel grant), you <b>must</b> submit an abstract.

	<p>Register for the Proxima Symposium and apply to be selected for an oral or poster presentation. The Scientific Committee will select up to 12 abstract submissions to present as short talks (15 minutes presentation). In addition, up to 60 abstract submissions will be selected for poster presentations (concurrent with the happy hour on Monday or Tuesday). Undergraduate and graduate students are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract.</p>

	<h3>Key dates</h3>
	Abstract submissions opens: May X, 2023
	Abstract submissions closes: July X, 2023

	<p>Each participant is allowed to submit <b>one</b> abstract as the <b>presenting</b> author. You may be an author in more than one abstract but will not be allowed to present more than one. Please verify you abstracts for clearness, conciseness, and correctness of spelling and grammar in advance of submission. Each submitted abstract should only have one presenting author. Abstracts must be submitted in English and if selected for presentation, all content (talk or poster) must be presented in English.</p>

	<h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>

	<p>Abstract evaluation will be double-blind and evaluated by 3 committee members. Authors are responsible for anonymizing their submissions. Do not include author names, author affiliations, or acknowledgments in the abstract, body, or figures of the submission. If you need to cite one of your own publications, use anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing (e.g., write "in previous works [1]...” instead of “in our previous work [1]...”).</p>

	<p>Abstract submissions will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: significance, originality, clarity and relevance to the symposium audience. Selected abstracts will be informed if they were selected for Poster or Oral presentation.</p>

	<p>For question on abstract submission, please send an email to xxx.</p>
