		<p>The Proxima Symposium, previously known as the Symposium on Biomedical Sciences (SBS) is an annual international symposium which aims to create a local culture of gathering Latin American students and motivated young investigators from the world-renowned universities to discuss current state-of-the-art work in the biomedical sciences in Brazil. The interactive format of the seminars stimulates students who aim to pursue a career abroad to be in close contact with the speakers. We work particularly hard to match students and scientists to instigate the education of young talented Brazilian students abroad.</p>

		<h4>Come back soon for a full report on previous editions of the Symposium and their impact on trainees' careers.</h4>
