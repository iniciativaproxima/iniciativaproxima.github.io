			<h1>Empower Young Brazilian Scientists<br>Donate to Iniciativa Proxima</h1>
		</header>

	<p>Iniciativa Proxima thrives on a mission to close the opportunity gap in science and foster community values within young Brazilian scientists. Our work thus far, powered by volunteer efforts, the Yale Office of International Affairs, and the laboratory of Dr. Marcelo Dietrich, has been transformative. Yet, we need your support to continue this vital work and expand our impact.</p>

	<p>Even a small donation can make a big difference. Your contribution will help us run our mentorship program, host impactful symposiums, initiate new projects, and empower us to hire full-time team members to enhance our efforts. More importantly, your gift aids in equipping the next generation of scientists with the tools and resources they need to drive scientific innovation and contribute to their communities.</p>

	<p>Consider this: a recurring donation of just $30 a month for two years can support the average cost of one student to travel to the Proxima Symposium from anywhere in Brazil. This decreases the opportunity gap for students from less privileged regions and enables them to learn, grow, and contribute in ways they might not otherwise have had the opportunity to.</p>

	<p>Join us in our commitment to young Brazilian scientists by making a one-time gift or setting up a recurring donation. Together, we can create a vibrant, inclusive scientific community that embraces collaboration and drives societal impact.</p>
